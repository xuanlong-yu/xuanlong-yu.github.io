Xuanlong Yu will join Intellindust, China in Aug 2024 as a senior computer vision engineer working with Dr. [Xi Shen](https://xishen0220.github.io/). 
Previously, Xuanlong Yu completed his Ph.D. in 2023 at Université Paris-Saclay and ENSTA Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France, under the supervision of Prof. [Emanuel Aldea](https://hebergement.universite-paris-saclay.fr/emi/) and Prof. [Gianni Franchi](https://giannifranchi.github.io/). His research interests lie in AI safety, specifically uncertainty quantification in deep learning, as well as 2D animation video generation and multimodal learning.
